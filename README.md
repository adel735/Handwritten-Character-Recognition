# Handwritten-Character-Recognition
In this Project, The computer will recognize handwritten characters in English alphabets from A-Z. This will be achieved by modeling a neural network that will have to be trained over a dataset containing images of alphabets.

# Conclusion
I have successfully developed Handwritten character recognition (Text Recognition) with Python, Tensorflow, and Machine Learning libraries.

Handwritten characters have been recognized with more than 97% test accuracy. This can be also further extended to identifying the handwritten characters of other languages too.
